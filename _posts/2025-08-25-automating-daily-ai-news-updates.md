---

In the fast-moving world of AI, staying updated is crucial. I recently built a small but powerful system that automatically tweets the latest updates on AI every day. Here's how I approached it.

## The Core Idea

The goal was simple: deliver fresh AI news daily without manual intervention. I wanted a reliable, low-maintenance solution that runs automatically on a set schedule.

## Technical Stack and Architecture

I chose a serverless approach, leveraging AWS for its ease of deployment and scalability:

- **AWS Lambda:** The brain of the operation, calling the Perplexity API to fetch recent AI news.
- **AWS EventBridge:** A scheduled trigger that runs the Lambda function at a specific time each day.
- **X API:** Used for posting updates directly to my X (Twitter) account.

This setup ensures that every morning, a curated update is generated effortlessly.

## Implementation Highlights

- The Lambda function makes an API call to Perplexity, retrieves the latest AI news, and formats it into a tweet.
- AWS EventBridge triggers the Lambda every day at the same time, maintaining consistency.
- Error handling and logging are set up to ensure smooth operation and easy troubleshooting.

## What I Learned

Building this automated pipeline reinforced the importance of simplicity and reliability. Serverless architecture minimizes maintenance, while scheduled triggers guarantee consistency. Itâ€™s a small project, but it brings immense value by keeping me informed with minimal effort.

This project has been invaluable in deepening my understanding of Perplexity's APIs, experiencing vibe coding with Cursor, and gaining practical, hands-on expertise with AWS EventBridge and Lambda. Overall, it significantly boosted my focus on technical learnings.
