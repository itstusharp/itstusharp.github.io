Marty Cagan's "Empowered" changed how I think about engineering leadership. Here are the ideas that stuck with me.

## Three Key Concepts

### 1. Problems, Not Features
Give teams problems to solve, not features to build. Empowered teams own outcomes, not just output.

**My take:**
This is the core shift for me. I've found that moving accountability from story points (output) to commitment reliability (outcome) fundamentally changes team behavior. When a team owns the problem, they automatically prioritize finishing committed work over starting new tasks.

### 2. Engineering in Discovery
Engineers belong in product discovery, not just delivery. Technical feasibility and innovation happen early, not in a "tech spec" phase.

**My Example:**
When faced with a complex system modernization project, we shifted our initial planning. Instead of waiting for a finalized requirements document, the engineering team led architectural visualization workshops (like adopting the C4 Model). This allowed engineers to proactively identify risks and dependencies, letting us design an effective iterative delivery strategy from the start.

### 3. Coach, Don't Control
Great managers develop judgment in their teams through coaching, not by making every decision themselves.

**My Approach:**
When facing challenges with basic professional standards (e.g., meeting norms or communication), I shift instantly from rule enforcement to diagnostic coaching. I focus on asking, "What is the unaddressed blocker or misunderstanding of the why?" to address the root cause of the behavior, rather than simply punishing the visible symptom.

## What I'm Applying

1. Driving Architectural Clarity through the systematic use of the C4 Model in our core domains.
2. Treating predictability and commitment as the highest cultural metrics, supported by specific process experiments.
3. Formally defining and growing technical leadership roles within the team (e.g., Staff Engineer competencies) to scale influence and mentorship.

## Bottom Line

True empowerment is the strategic act of granting clear context and accountability, then coaching the team to meet the standard.
