description: "My experience building a minimal, stream-based portfolio website"
---

I recently rebuilt my portfolio from scratch with one goal in mind: simplicity. After years of seeing overly complex portfolio sites, I wanted something that focused on content rather than flashy animations.

## The Design Philosophy

The core idea was to create a stream-based layout that tells a story chronologically. Instead of boxing projects into cards, I let them flow naturally down the page with a timeline on the left.

### Key Design Decisions

- No borders or backgrounds - let the content breathe
- Minimal hover effects - subtle opacity changes only
- Center-aligned content for better readability
- Timeline dots to guide the eye without being intrusive

## Technical Stack

Keeping with the minimal theme, I used just the basics:

- Semantic HTML5 for structure
- CSS with custom properties for easy theming
- A tiny bit of JavaScript for smooth scrolling and nav highlighting

## What I Learned

Building something minimal is actually harder than it looks. Every element has to justify its existence. There's nowhere to hide - every spacing decision, every color choice matters.

The result? A portfolio that loads instantly, works everywhere, and lets my work speak for itself.
